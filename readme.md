Cyprus Cities Website - README

Overview

This project is a web-based platform designed to showcase information about various cities in Cyprus. The website is constructed using HTML to establish the content structure and CSS to apply stylistic elements. This README provides a comprehensive guide on how the HTML and CSS were created.

The HTML file (index.html) begins with a Document Type Declaration, specifying the document type and language:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">




Head Section
Within the <head> section, external resources are linked, such as the CSS file (style.css) and a JavaScript file (script.js). The page title is also defined:
<head>
    <!-- Links to external stylesheets and scripts -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    <script defer src="script.js"></script>

    <!-- Title of the page -->
    <title>Cities of Cyprus</title>
</head>

The main content resides in the <body> section, encompassing the header, individual sections for each city, and a footer:
<body>
    <!-- Header, Sections for each city, and Footer -->
</body>




Footer Section
The footer includes a copyright notice:
